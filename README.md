# password-generator
I used Python, tkinter, and customtkinter to create a random password generator GUI. 

Each password generated will have the option to include special characters or not through a checkbox. The standard password will include 
numbers, lowercase letter, and uppercase letters. As an added measure of depth to the program, I've coded logic to only take in digits. Any
other responses, including strings and or negative integers, will be met with a message box that will prompt the user to input the correct
type of data. I hope you find this generator useful!
